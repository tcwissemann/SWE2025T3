        Hi, I'm Thomas Wissemann. I'm a junior at St. Edward's University currently studying Computer Science.
        I have experience working with web technologies before but I'm excited to learn more about full-stack development.
        I look forward to working with a team to create a project that will be used by others.

      <div class="text">
        Prior to attending St. Edward's, I was a Jazz major at the University of North Texas. I enjoy playing with friends, and gigging around Austin.

        When I'm not working or studying, I love to go hiking with friends. I've been to many of the trails around the greater Austin area and I'm always looking for new ones to explore.
