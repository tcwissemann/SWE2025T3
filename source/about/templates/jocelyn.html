      My name is Jocelyn Vega. I'm a senior computer science student at St. Edward's University. I am inclined towards backend development and low-level programming. I have some experience on writing assembly and C. Through this project, I hope to gain more experience in working with backend technologies like Django, and deepening my understanding of Database management using Django's ORM and PostgreSQL. Furthermore, I am looking forwards to learning leading industry practices for web-based projects and a diverse skillset including some frontend technologies like Alpine and Bootstrap.

      I have a great interest of the medium of manga, and the way its best authors are able to portray stories with the use of both written and visual tools. For me it serves as a medium of self-expression that has inspired a lot of my personal artistic endeavours.

      Since I was a kid I have enjoyed playing lots of videogames. I grew up playing with Nintendo consoles like the Wii, GameBoy Advance and Nintendo Switch. Their games mean a lot to me because off their accessibility and ease of understanding; which makes them one of my main inspirations on designing programs with care and thought on how to satisfy user's needs.
