      Hello! I'm Swapnil Puri, a computer science student at St. Edward's University. I have a passion for frontend development, particularly in designing visually engaging websites and implementing dynamic effects. Iâ€™ve worked with various libraries like Three.js and GSAP to create unique and interactive web experiences. Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of full-stack development and gain a stronger grasp of industry best practices, such as naming conventions, file organization standards, and specific software tools. I'm excited to collaborate on a web-related project and look forward to further honing my skills.

      Since childhood, I have enjoyed playing the Yu-Gi-Oh! trading card game. My passion for the game began after watching the anime. I especially love playing with the Mermail-Atlantean and Evil Eye decks.

      I have always had a deep connection to music, which sparked my passion for producing tracks using Ableton. This interest in music began at a young age when I learned to play several instruments, including the piano and cello.
